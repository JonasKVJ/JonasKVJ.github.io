# ABOUT #
This is a portfolio website and independent practice project, with an emphasis on full-stack and front-end development.
In order to get a sense of my prior experience with the back end, such as connecting a registration form to a MySQL database, please see the (SFSU Marketplace)[https://github.com/JonasKVJ/SFSU-Marketplace] repository instead.
