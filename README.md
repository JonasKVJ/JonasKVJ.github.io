# ABOUT #
Welcome to my portfolio site, intended as a practice project centered on full-stack and front-end development.
For anyone interested in my college experience with the back end (involving a registration form and MySQL database), please see the [SFSU Marketplace](https://github.com/JonasKVJ/SFSU-Marketplace) project instead.

Relevant skills and technologies: Git, VIM (syntax highlighing and indentation), Github, HTML, Jekyll, Github Pages
