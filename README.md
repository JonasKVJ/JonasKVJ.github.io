# ABOUT #
This is a portfolio website and independent practice project, with an emphasis on full-stack and front-end development.
For anyone interested in my college experience with the back end (involving a registration form and a MySQL database), please see the [SFSU Marketplace](https://github.com/JonasKVJ/SFSU-Marketplace) project instead.
